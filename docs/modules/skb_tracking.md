# SKB tracking

The `skb-tracking` collector does not track itself `skb` in the kernel (this is
done in the core) but allows to report the tracking information in the events.
This tracking information, which is basically an unique "id", can be used at
post-processing time to reconstruct in-kernel packets flow using the `sort`
post-processing command.

## Event

```
#{tracking id} (skb {skb address})
```

The `tracking id` is a unique id generated by Retis' tracking logic. The socket
buffer address is also returned in the tracking events to help distinguish
between clones (as they share the same tracking id).
