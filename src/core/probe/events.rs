//! # Events
//!
//! Handle events reported by the Linux kernel probes. A ring buffer is used to
//! convey events from kernel probes to userspace. This was preferred over
//! perfbuf as it presents many advantages leading to better performances. To
//! further improve performances per-CPU ring buffers can be used, this might be
//! an improvement for later. See https://nakryiko.com/posts/bpf-ringbuf/ and
//! tools/testing/selftests/bpf/progs/test_ringbuf_multi.c (in the kernel source
//! tree).
