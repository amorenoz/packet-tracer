//! # Kernel probes
//!
//! Module providing an API to attach probes in the Linux kernel, e.g. using
//! kprobes and raw tracepoints. The need to attach a probe in the kernel can
//! come from various sources (different collectors, the user, etc) and as such
//! some kind of synchronization and common logic is required; which is provided
//! here.

#![allow(dead_code)] // FIXME
